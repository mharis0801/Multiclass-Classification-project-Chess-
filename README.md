# Multiclass-Classification-project-Chess


The goal is to predict the outcome variable 'won' based on various features. The Project showcases the entire machine learning pipeline with PyCaret, starting from data setup and model comparison to hyperparameter tuning, ensemble learning, model interpretation, and deployment options. The final model chosen has various actions like creating a Gradio app, an API, a Docker container, and deploying on AWS S3 are demonstrated. Additionally, the Project includes functions to save and load the trained model and the entire experiment. The performance of the Decision Tree Classifier had the best accuracy and TT. In the classification Experiment the Light Gradient Boosting Machine had the best performance .
